H atom naming rule -- adopted from PDB 

Hydrogen Atoms

In brief, conventions for hydrogen atoms in version 3.0 PDB format are as follows:

Hydrogen atom records follow the records of all other atoms of a particular residue.
A hydrogen atom name starts with H. The next part of the name is based on the name of the connected nonhydrogen atom. For example, in amino acid residues, H is followed by the remoteness indicator (if any) of the connected atom, followed by the branch indicator (if any) of the connected atom; if more than one hydrogen is connected to the same atom, an additional digit is appended so that each hydrogen atom will have a unique name. Hydrogen atoms in standard nucleotides and amino acids (other than the rarely seen HXT) are named according to the IUPAC recommendations (Pure Appl Chem 70:117 (1998) [abstract] [PDF]). Names of hydrogen atoms in HETATM residues are determined in a similar fashion.
If the name of a hydrogen has four characters, it is left-justified starting in column 13; if it has fewer than four characters, it is left-justified starting in column 14.
In the following excerpt from entry 1vm3, atom H is attached to atom N. Atom HA is attached to atom CA; the remoteness indicator A is the same for these atoms. Two hydrogen atoms are connected to CB, one is connected to CG, three are connected to CD1, and three are connected to CD2.
