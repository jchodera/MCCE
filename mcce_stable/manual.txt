Prepare a parameter file for a new cofactor 

       A parameter file (tpl file) defines the cofactor structure such as 
connectivity,  physics properties such as atom sizes and charges, chemistry 
properties such as  the pKa values, and instructions of making rotamers. The
file must have extention ".tpl" to be effective.

       This section is a description about how to make a new tpl file. Two parts 
are included, part I will show you how to make a new tpl file without charge 
part, and part II will show how to make charge part.


Part I : Make a tpl file

       First of all, in order to make a tpl file, a pdb file is needed. 
You should make a directory to run mcce program. For more details, you can do that 
as following:

1.  Copy run.prm file and the pdb file (e.g. Let's say abcd.pdb) to your new local directory. 
2.  Edit run.prm:  put the right pdb name (abcd.pdb), change the pathway of the name.txt file 
    to your local directory, and set to ready to run step1 only.

    For example, here is the first part of one run.prm file to run  abcd.pdb

MCCE CONFIGURATION FILE...

Input and Output:
abcd.pdb                                                     (INPDB)*
param                                                        (PARAM)*
debug.log                                                    (DEBUG_LOG)
new.tpl     local parameter file for unrecognized res        (NEWTPL)

Steps:
t        step 1: pre-run, pdb-> mcce pdb                     (DO_PREMCCE)*
t        step 2: make rotatmers                              (DO_ROTAMERS)*
f        step 3: do energy calculations                      (DO_ENERGY)*
f        step 4: monte carlo sampling                        (DO_MONTE)*
...

step 1:
name.txt MCCE renaming rule.                                 (RENAME_RULES)*


t        Label terminal residues?                            (TERMINALS)
->
f        Label terminal residues?                            (TERMINALS)


2.0      distance limit of reporting clashes                 (CLASH_DISTANCE)
0.2      cut off water if % SAS exceeds this number          (H2O_SASCUTOFF)




3. Edit the name.txt file in the same directory. You should convert all atoms into 
   the same residue name, the same chain ID and the same residue number. Please follow 
   the format of pdb files. look up more details in the following link: 
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html

Here is an example of file "name.txt":
...
####_###_#_###  ####_###_#_###
*D************  *H************      rename all atom D to H
***** CU A 005  *****CUB*A*005
*****HIS A 284  a****CUB*A*005
*****HIS A 333  b****CUB*A*005
*****HIS A 334  c****CUB*A*005
1****HIS A 284  1****CUB*A*005
2****HIS A 284  2****CUB*A*005


4. Now run mcce program:  $mcce &    It will take a short time to get results in step1_out.pdb. 
   Check this file to make sure all atoms are converted and loaded. The other logout files are
   helpful when you check and analysis the results. The main logout file (default one is run.log) 
   will tell you the status of the work. Debug.log is the necessary file to check if the work 
   is not finished. Repeat the step until it is done. Then look into new.tpl file. 
   In this file, the guessed connectivity part is presented.
Note:
1). The guessed connectivity part is not the final one. You have to   
    check that with the real structure, and correct that. First, check 
    the hydrogens. Sometimes, hydrogens are missing in the structure 
    connectivity part, you can edit the file and add the hydrogen in the 
    line of covalent-bonded atom. Second, Add ligands connectivity  
    for  sidechain atoms if they are not shown. e.g. you should put the 
    connectivity CA with the atom CB, although the backbone atom CA is 
    not shown in that conformer.
2). You do not have to edit the CONFLIST, NATOM, IATOM and 
    ATOMNAME parts. Actually, it will be corrected later once     
    you have the right connectivity part.

5. Use the program mk_iatom to make CONFLIST, NATOM,  
   IATOM and ATOMNAME parts.  You will see a new tpl file is   
   created, which is complete except the radius and charge part.

6. Put this new tpl file into param directory (your local param 
   directory is recommended). Remove the file "new.tpl" in the current directory
   Then run mcce (step1) again. If any warning message is found in the file 
   "run.log" or "debug.log", follow the warning messages and restart mcce (step1)
    until no warning message is shown.    

Part II: Adding atomic charges into the tpl files.
       Normally, if you know the structure and have a tpl file coming from Part I, you can do 
the following to complete the tpl file. 

1. Run mcce(step 1 and step 2), make sure you can get the file step1_out.pdb and step2_out.pdb.  

2. Transfer the file format. Use program such as babel to transfer the format of an output 
   file with atomic charges (e.g. the output files from program gaussian) to the pdb format. 
   We can use this command to transfer formats in babel: $babel -i gauout abcd.log -o pdb abcd.pdb .

3. Transfer the atom names. The program match_atoms can do most of the job. Run $match_atoms [file1]  [file2]. 
  (File 1 is the file from last step showing the pdb format. File 2 is step1_out.pdb). This program will 
  print the matching atomic informations one by one. Check the output file matched.pdb.
Note: This is important to check the matching information (from   
     the screen) with the real structure. Sometimes, if some small  
     optimization have been done to the original pdb crystal    
     structure to get charges in some programs, the matching  
     information of proton in matched.pdb file may be not right.
     In some other cases, some atoms will not be matched, check 
     those atom names.

3. Now you have the charge part from some other program, and  the pdb-format atom names. 
   Try to use excel to match them. Paste this information into the tpl file in the following  
   format:

 #3.Atom Parameters: Partial Charges and Radii
CHARGE   HEA01 aCB   -0.065
CHARGE   HEA01 1HB    0.150
CHARGE   HEA01 2HB    0.150
CHARGE   HEA01 aCG   -0.283


4.Now you can add the radius part also in tpl file following the following format:

# Radii from "Bondi, J.Phys.Chem., 68, 441, 1964."
RADIUS   HEA   FE   1.45
RADIUS   HEA    CHA 1.80
RADIUS   HEA    CHB 1.80
RADIUS   HEA    CHC 1.80

Part III. Get pKa, Em, charges and calculated energies.
    After Part I and Part II, actually you are ready to run mcce now. First of all, you should put the
new tpl file into your param directory. Then run mcce from step 1 to step 4 (modify run.prm file). 
The files below are given to check charges, pKa, Em and pairwise interactions 

results                                       files
charges            ------------------------   sum_crg.out
pKa                ------------------------   pK.out
EM                 ------------------------   pK.out
pairwise energies  ------------------------   ./energies/*.opp
occupancy          ------------------------   fort.38
residues surface   ------------------------   acc.res
atom surface       ------------------------   acc.atm
rotamer making     ------------------------   rot_stat

Note: 
Before running mcce program, if you want to calculate pKa or Em, you have to edit run.prm. 
There is a line labeling ph or Eh in step4 of file run.prm. Compare the different below:

...
ph       "ph" fpr pH titration, "eh" for eh titration       (TITR_TYPE)
0.0      Initial pH                                         (TITR_PH0)  
1.0      pH interval                                        (TITR_PHD)
0.0      Initial Eh                                         (TITR_EH0)
30.0     Eh interval (in mV)                                (TITR_EHD)
1        Number of titration points                         (TITR_STEPS)

1.0      pH interval                                        (TITR_PHD)
0.0      Initial Eh                                         (TITR_EH0)
30.0     Eh interval (in mV)                                (TITR_EHD)
1        Number of titration points                         (TITR_STEPS)   
...
